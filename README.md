# You are in your final year of a STEM degree...
And you aren't sure where to begin in job searching.

In this repository I'd like to share my tips and tricks for being successful when applying for STEM
positions as a college student.  


## Who am I?
I graduated with a degree in Computational Mathematics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 2019 with a 
specialization in Physics, and dual minors: Psychology and Applied Meteorology.  I worked in the Academic Advancement Center
at Riddle in the Writing Center and helped many students fine-tune their resumes and writing.  In my final year, I lead a 
research project in Data Science / Machine Learning, and promptly found my way into the data industry.  I applied for roughly 
60-80 jobs in my final two semesters and got hired a few weeks before I graduated in May 2020.

As part of my job I had the opportunity to represent my company at multiple job fairs at Boston University and Harvard 
University, and then be an active part in the selection of candidates for the following years' new hires.  It was an 
eye-opening experience to, within only a short period of time, go from being the candidate to seeing how I was picked, 
and being the company rep at a job fair.  So, I figure it would be worth it to help other fresh graduates have a better
shot at getting their foot in the door of the world of STEM opportunities.


## Truth & Basics
The realities to understand about being a successful first-time STEM job finder:

1. You will need a portfolio.
2. You will need to move for the job.
3. You will need to have *some* experience with relevant tech in your field.
4. You will need to start the job-searching process early in your final year.

### You will need a portfolio
It's really that simple.  Not a single person I saw hired and/or helped select for candidacy was missing a portfolio. You
will need, at the bare minimum, a GitHub, website, or other showcasing platform to display your work.  Other useful things
to add to a portfolio and/or that "add additional documents" upload button that most job postings will offer: publications 
(undergraduate research journal publications are nothing to scoff at - that's all I had), conference posters, applicable 
term papers, any impressive awards, test results, etc.  If you work really hard at fine-tuning a website or GitHub that you 
absolutely want to be looked at, then don't water your application down with a bunch of other links.

But most of all - you need to *show* that you are capable of doing industry-level work.  Not just coursework.  And I mean by that,
for example in the world of data science, we'd want to see in your portfolio the entire process of data science-ing. Initial
exploratory data analysis, choosing a model (or models, preferably), implementing the model, testing it, analyzing results, 
presentation of the results, visualization to make it easy to understand said results, and any other processes that you actively
did to make the project happen.

I used [this GitHub page](https://github.com/mathemacode/) as my portfolio, but at the time I was applying for jobs, the
main attraction was [this single repository with my senior research capstone](https://github.com/mathemacode/FosterCare_Project). Here
I took a complex, real-world problem from a real company and did my best to use relevant tools and technology to get results
and made visualizations to share the results.  This is not a perfect portfolio example - but something to consider as you
build yours.  Organization, cleanliness, and clarity are imperative.  No recruiter is going to spend 15 minutes trying to unzip
a bunch of coursework `daniel-hw5-edited.c` files, compile them, and then run them for you.  **YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE** in making sure
that your skills are adequately shown, and easy to recognize in your portfolio.  This is show, not tell.

#### Certain skills to show in your portfolio
1. Organization: make it clear what the project objective was.  Fancy math formulas and other complex scientific mumbo jumbo only 
hold their weight if you explain (in laymans terms - HR will be viewing this too - not just the scientific recruiters) the
relevance to the project.  Use markdown for a GitHub repo.  A GitHub repo means next to nothing if there is no ReadMe to explain
what all those files are about.  Make clearly defined sections (goals, analysis, results, conclusion, further work), and 
**include graphics**.

2. Soft skills (writing, communication): A publication is a great way to show your writing skills, but you can easily show them
through a well-written GitHub repo or website.  Proofread - go to the Writing Center for a second opinion 

3. Attitude
