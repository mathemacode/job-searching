# You are in your final year of a STEM degree...
And you aren't sure where to begin in job searching.

In this repository I'd like to share my tips and tricks for being successful when applying for STEM
positions as a college student.  


## Who am I?
I graduated with a degree in Computational Mathematics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 2019 with a 
specialization in Physics, and dual minors: Psychology and Applied Meteorology.  I worked in the Academic Advancement Center
at Riddle in the Writing Center and helped many students fine-tune their resumes and writing.  In my final year, I lead a 
research project in Data Science / Machine Learning, and promptly found my way into the data industry.  I applied for roughly 
60-80 jobs in my final two semesters and got hired a few weeks before I graduated in May 2020.

As part of my job I had the opportunity to represent my company at multiple job fairs at Boston University and Harvard 
University, and then be an active part in the selection of candidates for the following years' new hires.  It was an 
eye-opening experience to, within only a short period of time, go from being the candidate to seeing how I was picked, 
and being the company rep at a job fair.  So, I figure it would be worth it to help other fresh graduates have a better
shot at getting their foot in the door of the world of STEM opportunities.


## Truth & Basics
The realities to understand about being a successful first-time STEM job finder:

1. You will need a portfolio.
2. You will need to move for the job.
3. You will need to have *some* experience with relevant tech in your field.
4. You will need to start the job-searching process early in your final year.

### You will need a portfolio
It's really that simple.  Not a single person I saw hired and/or helped select for candidacy was missing a portfolio. You
will need, at the bare minimum, a GitHub, website, or other showcasing platform to display your work.  Other useful things
to add to a portfolio and/or that "add additional documents" upload button that most job postings will offer: publications 
(undergraduate research journal publications are nothing to scoff at - that's all I had), conference posters, applicable 
term papers, any impressive awards, test results, etc.  If you work really hard at fine-tuning a website or GitHub that you 
absolutely want to be looked at, then don't water your application down with a bunch of other links.

But most of all - you need to *show* that you are capable of doing industry-level work.  Not just coursework.  And I mean by that,
for example in the world of data science, we'd want to see in your portfolio the entire process of data science-ing. Initial
exploratory data analysis, choosing a model (or models, preferably), implementing the model, testing it, analyzing results, 
presentation of the results, visualization to make it easy to understand said results, and any other processes that you actively
did to make the project happen.

I used [this GitHub page](https://github.com/mathemacode/) as my main portfolio link, and at the time I was applying for jobs, the
main attraction was [this single repository with my senior research capstone](https://github.com/mathemacode/FosterCare_Project). Here
I took a complex, real-world problem from a real company and did my best to use relevant tools and technology to get results
and made visualizations to share the results.  This is not a perfect portfolio example - but something to consider as you
build yours.  Organization, cleanliness, and clarity are imperative.  Very few recruiters will spend 15 minutes trying to unzip
a bunch of coursework `daniel-hw5-edited.c` files, compile them, and then run them for you.  

**YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE** in making sure
that your skills are adequately shown, and easy to recognize in your portfolio.  This is show, not tell.

#### Certain skills to show in your portfolio
1. Organization: make it clear what the project objective was.  Fancy math formulas and other complex scientific mumbo jumbo only 
hold their weight if you explain (in laymans terms - HR will be viewing this too - not just the scientific recruiters) the
relevance to the project.  Use markdown for a GitHub repo.  A GitHub repo means next to nothing if there is no ReadMe to explain
what all those files are about.  Make clearly defined sections (goals, analysis, results, conclusion, further work), and 
**include graphics**.

2. Soft skills (writing, communication): A publication is a great way to show your writing skills, but you can easily show them
through a well-written GitHub repo or website.  Proofread and go to the Writing Center for a second opinion.  Communication
skills can also be demonstrated through just having experience going to conferences and even putting your conference posters
as PDFs somewhere in your portfolio.

3. Attitude: Keep things professional and not too tacky. It's easily to get carried away with colors and excessive formatting, 
or in the case of websites, heavy scripting to make the website extra fancy.  Focus more on upgrading your content and not
just the format of the portfolio itself.  Also, have a professional profile picture.  It doesn't need to be a basic headshot, but
resist the urge to put in a fancy logo of your favorite e-sports team.

### You will need to move for the job
Enough said.

In the world of STEM, the chance of you going to a university outside of a large city, and then landing a job within driving distance
in the same area are very slim.  At the very least, expect to move at least to a different part of the state you're in.  Obviously 
everybody's situation will differ - but making the mistake of limiting your job search to a single state is a huge roadblock in
the process.  So, when you start your job search (and I will get to how to use Indeed and other platforms properly as a new grad) - the absolute 
finest grain that you should restrict your job search is within the same state.

**This also means that you should start saving up NOW to make the move**.  Even if your new company offers to reimburse your 
moving expense, you'll probably get that money in your 2nd paycheck or beyond, and just a credit card may not cut it. Getting a new 
apartment in the city will cost you.  **USING FACEBOOK GROUPS TO FIND ROOMMATES** is a great idea but obviously never, ever, ever put down
ANY amount of money for a place that you haven't physically been to yet.  Apartments.com is full of these scams where somebody will say 
"ohh... I work on a ship offshore so won't be home for many months, I can ship you the key if you PayPal me"... scams are abundant in the 
world of renting apartments.  Facebook has tons of groups, named, for example, "Seattle Housing", where people find good deals on 
splitting rent with like-minded people.

In this day and age it's safe to assume that you will be paying at least $1000 per month on just rent, with roommates.  For a single 
apartment, expect $1500+ if you will not be sharing it.  In Boston, add another $500.  In NYC, add another $1000.  You will need to 
use those same Facebook groups for market research on how much rent generally is and therefore, how much you will need to save.  When you
move in, you'll need to pay 2-3 months of rent right off the bat (usually): first month, security deposit, and then there is sometimes a 
broker's fee of 1 month's rent.  So, for a $1500 apartment, you will need $4500 off the bat just to move in.  And this doesn't include
furniture, pots and pans, electricity, heat, etc etc etc... if you have only lived in a dorm for your time in college, this change
will be a bit more drastic but is nothing to worry about as long as you plan ahead.  **START SAVING NOW**
